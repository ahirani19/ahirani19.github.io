        <!-- Introduction -->
        <div class="case-study-section">
            <p>Torchlight is a web-based data visualization tool made to help people debug machine learning models. It
                displays metrics, graphs, and allows you to step through your model to see how these facets adjust in
                real time.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Problem Statement -->
        <div class="case-study-section">
            <h2>problem:</h2>
            <p>Machine learning models are incredibly information dense. For our intended users of the platform, namely
                students, information needs to be displayed in such a way that the dynamic visuals are easy to read and
                understand, especially since pinpointing the exact reason for something like overfitting, unexpected
                results, etc. becomes hidden behind the numerous variables.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Problem Details -->
        <div class="case-study-section">
            <p><strong>1. Many moving parts:</strong> There are a variable number of layers, each with their own
                weights,
                biases, and other overhead like kernels, batch size, etc. Tracking every single one of these variables
                becomes a nightmare, especially without any visual aides.</p>

            <p><strong>2. Abstract concepts:</strong> For students who've never seen or tested a model before, the gap
                between the mathematical basis and real world application of the model becomes a barrier. Take the idea
                of a "layer" on a model - what exactly is it? What does it look like, how does it help a model's
                evolution? Having a more concrete idea of things like layers help make machine learning more intuitive,
                and debugging less like guesswork.</p>

            <p><strong>3. Disconnected metrics:</strong> Model layers feed into each other, acting as both input and
                output
                in a continuous flow. Providing one set of output metrics rather than specific metrics at each milestone
                the model isolates the model and hides the truth of machine learning models, which is that they are a
                very dynamic and evolving process. More importantly, when unexpected things happen during model testing,
                it becomes immensely difficult to pinpoint where exactly certain variables begin to change, impact
                results, or otherwise improve or degrade performance.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Goals -->
        <div class="case-study-section">
            <h2>our goals:</h2>
            <p>1. Decrease cognitive load by providing a modular way to view different information about the model.</p>
            <p>2. Enable debugging akin to a debugger in a code IDE, a useful existing tool, to help students see
                incremental updates in their models.</p>
            <p>3. Create a concrete visual representation of abstract objects such as layers and kernels.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Exploration Section -->
        <div class="case-study-section">
            <h2>exploration: figma dashboard</h2>
            <p>I took to Figma to create a detailed dashboard that accomplished the above goals as best as possible.
                Being both the only UI designer on the team while also being a programmer gave me a unique perspective
                on the problem; I understood firsthand which parts of machine learning felt so cryptic and difficult, so
                I kept those first-timer challenges in mind while designing the initial dashboard for this 24-hour
                sprint.</p>
            <p>I followed the convention of a zoned dashboard with three main zones, organizing controls, visualization,
                and metrics.</p>

            <p><strong>Control panel:</strong></p>
            <p>A Version Control panel, allowing you to save numerous versions of a model with different parameters.
                This allows students to go back to and compare different models with ease. Users can label and color
                code them for easy recognition.</p>
            <p>An Active Data panel lays out the visual structure of imported data sets. This helps error prevention,
                allowing users to see what data is being trained on and actively referenced.</p>
            <p>You can also change the color scheme at the bottom per user preference.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Sandbox Zone -->
        <div class="case-study-section">
            <p><strong>Sandbox zone:</strong></p>
            <p>In this clickable section, users can see layers, weights, biases, and other layer-specific information
                appear as they step through. This mock flow diagram shows just an initial layer, a multiplication layer,
                and an optimization algorithm being applied.</p>
            <p>The user can drag and zoom as they please with the provided control panel.</p>
            <p>We've directly addressed the need for a concrete visualization of layers with this panel; by making
                layers movable and labeled, we hope that users can more clearly understand what a layer consists of and
                how each part of the model feeds into the next.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Metric Dashboard -->
        <div class="case-study-section">
            <p><strong>Metric dashboard:</strong></p>
            <p>This is the section for model behavior and performance. Where the sandbox provides layer specific
                information, this section allows you to see the dynamic variables over time.</p>
            <p>The most pertinent metrics, the computation time, input and output shape are at the very top, with a
                "Node" (Layer) debugger below it. It's equipped with a slider allowing users to scrub through epochs and
                a bar chart of the evolving weights and biases, addressing the problem of disconnected metrics; the
                panel connects layer structure to dynamic behavior of the model.</p>
            <p>For convolutional (image-based) neural networks in particular, we provided a carousel view of the
                different matrices. In the mockup, the current layer of radiology images are highlighted with the before
                & after layers on either side, allowing the user to see the smooth flow of change between the
                convolutional layers.</p>
            <p>Below it comes more metric graphs for things such as backpropagation with epochs, and gradients, making
                unexpected behavior easy to identify.</p>
        </div>


        <!-- Visual Design -->
        <div class="case-study-section">
            <h2>visual design</h2>
            <p>A dark-mode UI was chosen as the default, following the convention of most IDEs; a dark background with
                colorful data nodes are visually easier to see and helps the different panels stand out.</p>
            <p>The default color scheme of purples, blues, and greens maintains cohesion while allowing warmer tones
                (like the green "Initialized" indicator or yellow highlights) to draw attention.</p>
            <p>For typography, I chose Homenaje for its readability and how it complements the data-heavy visuals while
                providing a modern feel.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Implementation Section -->
        <div class="case-study-section">
            <h2>implementation: scoping for a 24-hour sprint and object-oriented programming</h2>
            <p>As both the UI designer and frontend developer for this project, I had to turn my design decisions into
                engineering decisions all 24 hours. Our backend engineers transformed PyTorch tensors into object
                classes (Python based OOP). This made it easy to access and visualize certain variables. They created
                two custom classes; Node class objects holding layer information, and Edge class objects holding the
                connections to other layers.</p>
            <p>To create our dashboard, I translated these OOP objects into interactive React components.</p>

                    understanding how different configurations impacted results.</p>

                <p><strong>Layer visualizer:</strong></p>
                <p>For the sandbox feature, I used React (JavaScript) as well as regular web technologies (HTML/CSS) to
                    create the visuals. I mapped Node objects to square layers containing text of all its attributes,
                    and had the Edge objects connect each layer visually via dotted-line flow animations, making the
                    connections clear.</p>

                <p><strong>Metrics Dashboard:</strong></p>
                <p>We kept the core three (time, input and output) at the top, with an abundance of graphs now taking up
                    the panel. Variables shown in the graphs were easy to extract from the objects, hence the many
                    interactive graphs featuring weights, biases, epochs etc.</p>

                <p><strong>Kernel Carousel:</strong></p>
                <p>We also determined that the kernel carousel for CNN models was essential to aid visualization of each
                    layer. Color blocks stood in place of images for sheer size and clarity constraints.</p>

            <p><strong>Hover statistics:</strong> I added pop-up panels to graphs when a user hovered above a bar; they
                proved useful for quick comparisons and statistics.</p>
            <p><strong>Animated data flow:</strong> A dotted line flow animation using CSS brought the abstract
                'feeding' of variables into layers to fruition; the movement helps understanding of tensors moving
                through the model.</p>

            <p>The Active Data panel would have unnecessarily cluttered the clean UI, and variable comparison graphs (as
                shown in the Figma dashboard) would have defeated the purpose of making the machine learning model more
                modular and easy to debug.</p>
